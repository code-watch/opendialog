# OpenDialog - open-source conversational application platform

OpenDialog enables you to quickly design, develop and deploy conversational applications. 

You write conversational applications using OpenDialog's flexible no-code conversation designer and define the messages that your bot will send the user through OpenDialog's message editor.

The OpenDialog webchat widget allows you to interact with the application - it supports both an in-page popup experience as well as a full-page experience and mobile.

Behind the scenes this all gets translated into the OpenDialog Conversation Description Language and gets run through our powerful conversation engine, giving you flexible, sophisticated chat experiences everytime. 

For all the details of how OpenDialog helps you build sophisticated conversation applications visit our [documentation site](https://docs.opendialog.ai).


# Trying out OpenDialog

If you want to see OpenDialog in action you can try out the latest version through our automatically produced Docker image.

The [OpenDialog Quick Start Repo](https://github.com/opendialogai/quick-start) contains a `docker-compose.yml` file that will pull in the latest OpenDialog docker image and spin it up alongside all other containers needed to test out OpenDialog

As long as you have Docker installed on your local machine you can do:
- `git clone https://github.com/opendialogai/quick-start.git`
- `cd quick-start`
- `docker-compose up -d app`
- `docker-compose exec app bash docker/scripts/update-docker.sh`

You can then visit http://localhost and login to OpenDialog with admin@example.com / opendialog - you can also view the full page webchat experience on http://localhost/web-chat

There are more detailed instructions in readme the `quick-start` repo
